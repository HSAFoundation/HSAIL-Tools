			 BUILDING LIBHSAIL

1. PREREQUISITES:

Use GNU make. A native (e.g. MinGW) build of make should be used on Windows.

Building HSAILasm currently requires some components from LLVM (only Support
and Object libs are used). This dependency may be removed in the future. 
libHSAIL can be built without LLVM. The only LLVM dependency it has is the ELF
header file, which can be obtained from alternative sources.

LLVM can be downloaded from http://llvm.org/releases/. 
Most modern linux distributions include a precompiled LLVM package.
Building LLVM from source requires CMake: http://www.cmake.org/

A part of libHSAIL source files is generated using perl (5.10+) and re2c.
Pre-generated files are included in the source tree, so perl and re2c are not
mandatory prerequisites for building libHSAIL. However they are necessary if
you want to modify BRIG  data structures libHSAIL operates on, or HSAIL parser.

re2c is a lexer generator used in many open source projects including PHP. re2c
source, Windows binaries and some linux packages can be donwloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/re2c/. Most linux distributions also include a
re2c package.

Perl is typically included in any modern linux distribution. 
Perl for Windows can be obtained from any of the following sources:

* Activestate ActivePerl : http://www.activestate.com/activeperl
* Strawberry Perl : http://strawberryperl.com/
* as a part of Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/

Building on Linux requires GCC 4.4+.

Building on Windows requires MSVC (Visual Studio 2012 or 2010).

Alternatively you can use GCC (MinGW, TDM-GCC) on Windows. It can be
obtained from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download .

2. BUILDING:

You should define the following variables on make command line or pre-define 
them in the environment:

	LLVM_SRC:   pointing to LLVM source files.
        LLVM_BUILD: pointing to LLVM build directory  matching  your  build
                    settings. Windows build attempts  to  locate  the  libs  in
                    Debug or Release subdirectories of this path.
        LLVM_LIBS:  (optional, deduced from LLVM_BUILD) pointing  the  directory
                    with LLVM libs.
	_OPT:       (optional) define for an optimized build
	_DBG:       (optional) define for a build with debug symbols
	_M64:       (optional) define for a 64-bit build
	_M32:       (optional) define for a 32-bit build
        _GCC:       define to use use MinGW (or other GCC build) instead of  MSVC  on
                    Windows


Any combination of _OPT and _DBG is allowed. _M64 and _M32 can not be combined.

example: make -j LLVM_SRC=llvm31 LLVM_BUILD=llvm31/build _OPT=1 _M64=1

If you have 32-bit or 64-bit build of MSVC (cl.exe) in the path, it defines 
32-bit or 64-bit target configuration, which may not  conflict  with  _M64
or  _M32.  No attempts to auto-configure MSVC environment are made in this case.

If you are building with MSVC but do not have cl.exe in path, the build process 
attempts  to  locate  the 32-bit (if _M64 is unset) or 64-bit (if _M64 is set) 
build  of  the  compiler using the following environment variables, in order of
decreasing  preference:

	%VCINSTALLDIR%
	%VS110COMNTOOLS%
	%VS100COMNTOOLS%

Normally  %VS..COMNTOOLS%  variables  are added  to   the   system   environment
automatically. If there are any issues  with  auto-detection,  you  should  set
VCINSTALLDIR explicitly or just configure the paths manually.

3. SOURCE GENERATION:

To regenerate libHSAIL source files, run the following:

	cd libHSAIL
	perl generate.pl . generated

where "." is the input file path and "generated" is the output file path. If 
necessary, path to re2c build may be explicitly specified:

	perl generate.pl --re2c=my/build/of/re2c . generated
